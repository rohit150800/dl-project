# Hand and Face Gesture Based System Control using MediaPipe and OpenCV  

This project demonstrates how computer vision can be used to control system interactions through **hand and face gestures**.  
The implementation is built using **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **PyAutoGUI** for real-time interaction.  

### Features:
- **Hand Gestures**  
  - Open palm → Hover / Move mouse  
  - Closed palm → Click  
  - Index finger up → Move cursor upwards  
  - Pinky finger up → Move cursor downwards  
  - Both index fingers up → Scroll up  
  - Both pinky fingers up → Scroll down  
  - Both thumbs + pinky fingers → Scroll right  

- **Face Gestures**  
  - Tilt head right twice → Increase volume above 50%  
  - Tilt head left twice → Decrease volume by 30%  

This notebook provides an **interactive system control interface** without the need for physical input devices, paving the way for **gesture-driven human-computer interaction**.
